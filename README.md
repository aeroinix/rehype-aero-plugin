# Rehype Aero Plugin - Custom Code Blocks

### Version 0.0.1

### Not ready for production

Much more information to come here, please dont use this in production. But you are more then welcome to look at the code under `/lib` and take whatever you want.

This package is a customized version of what Expressive Code does. There is not really ever going to be a way for an end user to customize the way this plugin adjusts the DOM. This is just how I personally would want to build out my html code blocks. This package is more for me to easily test and build out what I need, outside of an actual project.

I am publishing it on Github so others can get an idea of how you may start doing something like this yourself.
